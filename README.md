# OT-SNE

This repository contains software implementing a _t_-SNE algorithm tailored for analysis of
time-series data. 

##### Notes
Our software is based on the implementation of Barnes-Hut _t_-SNE developed by Laurens van der Maaten at Delft University of Technology, available at: https://github.com/lvdmaaten/bhtsne

We are working on releasing wrappers in other programming languages such as R and Python. If you would like an update when these become available, feel free to drop us a note at the email address below.
